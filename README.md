# Time_Series_Analysis
Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on previously observed values. It's a crucial aspect of data analysis in numerous fields, enabling organizations and individuals to make informed decisions by projecting past trends into the future. The core importance of time series forecasting lies in its ability to identify patterns, trends, and cycles in historical data, and use these insights to predict future events. This predictive capability is invaluable for planning, budgeting, and managing resources effectively, ensuring that strategies are both proactive and responsive to anticipated changes.

# Why Keras is Suitable for Time Series Forecasting?
Keras is a powerful, user-friendly neural network library written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation with deep learning. It acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library, combining ease of use with flexibility, and is capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
1.   It offers a high-level, intuitive API, making it accessible for beginners while still being robust enough for research and development.
2.    It supports a wide range of network architectures, including fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), essential for handling various time series forecasting tasks.
3.    It is optimized for performance, allowing for rapid experimentation and iteration, which is crucial in the development and tuning of predictive models.

# Setting Up the Development Environment
Following the introduction to time series forecasting and the advantages of using Keras for such tasks, we now embark on the practical journey of implementing a time series forecasting model. In this section, we will set up our development environment and prepare our dataset for modeling. The Python libraries and tools we'll use form the backbone of our data processing and model development. Here's a breakdown of the code snippet and its components:

import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers, activations
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint

•	os: This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to a file system.

•	numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It's used for working with arrays and matrices, alongside a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

•	pandas: An essential library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

•	matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

•	sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler: A preprocessing module used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This is particularly important in neural networks to ensure that all input features have similar scale.

•	tensorflow: An open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning. TensorFlow offers a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

•	keras: Integrated into TensorFlow, it simplifies many operations and is used to build and train neural networks. We specifically import submodules for defining layers and activations, along with callbacks like EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint for model training optimization.

•	EarlyStopping: Monitors the model's performance on a validation set and stops training when the performance stops improving, preventing overfitting.

•	ModelCheckpoint: Saves the model at specific intervals, allowing us to keep the model at its best performance.
